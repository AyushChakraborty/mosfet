    Ever heard of <s>X</s> Twitter, must have heard of Jack Dorsey then. Heard
    of bitchat then? the decentralised chat app which works over bluetooth. Yes,
    me too. So much so that I wanted to make one of my own. I remember being
    fascinated by the whole idea of it and decided to build a very small version
    of it myself. Here is my journey of building it, the struggles and the
    learnings. Hopefully you get something out of it :).
